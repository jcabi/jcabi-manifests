Appending <<<ServletContext>>> Manifests to the Registry

  This is how
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/manifests/Manifests.html}<<<Manifests>>>}}
  utility class finds all <<<MANIFEST.MF>>> files available in the
  classpath:

+--
public class Manifests {
  public static void load() {
    // ...
    ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
    Enumeration<URL> resources = loader.getResources("META-INF/MANIFEST.MF");
  }
}
+--

  Context
  {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html}<<<ClassLoader>>>}}
  of a current
  {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html}<<<Thread>>>}}
  is being used to find all available
  <<<META-INF/MANIFEST.MF>>> files.
  This mechanism works just fine in web
  applications (<<<WAR>>> packages) as long as
  the current thread contains the same class loader as is being used in
  {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/ServletContext.html}<<<ServletContext>>>}}.
  In some web containers it is not true, and
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/manifests/Manifests.html}<<<Manifests>>>}}
  simply won't see your <<<MANIFEST.MF>>> files.

  To solve the problem there is a method
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/manifests/Manifests.html}<<<append(ServletContext)>>>}},
  which allows you to inform
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/manifests/Manifests.html}<<<Manifests>>>}}
  about an additional classloader available. You should call this method
  in one of your
  {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/ServletContextListener.html}<<<ServletContextListener>>>}}-s:

+--
public class MyListener implements ServletContextListener {
  @Override
  public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent event) {
    Manifests.append(event.getServletContext());
  }
}
+--

  You can call
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/manifests/Manifests.html}<<<append(ServletContext)>>>}}
  many times, it's harmless for the registry.
